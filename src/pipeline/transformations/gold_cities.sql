-- Pre-processed city lookup with polygons, centres, and bounding boxes.
-- Joins divisions + division_areas so the app never touches raw WKB geometry.
-- Polygon resolution: locality area first, then ST_Union of all same-name
-- region/county/neighborhood/macrohood areas (covers city-states and metro areas).
